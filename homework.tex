\subsection{Problem}
Given $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, prove that $3 \mid (n^3 - n)$.

\subsection{Solution}
TODO
We consider the following exhaustive cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $n$ is even, then $\exists k \in \Z$ such that $n = 2k$. We then have $n^3 - n = (2k)^3 - 2k = 8k^3 - 2k = 2k(4k^2 - 1)$
    \item If $n$ is odd, then $\exists k \in \Z$ such that $n = 2k + 1$. We then have $n^3 - n = (2k + 1)^3 - (2k + 1)$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Problem}
Given $a, b \in \Z$ such that $a$ and $b$ are odd, $b > 0$, and $b \nmid a$, prove that there exist $s, t \in \Z$ such that $a = bs + t$, $t$ is odd, and $\abs{t} < b$.

\subsection{Solution}
There exist $k, q \in \Z$ such that $a = 2k + 1$ and $b = 2q + 1$. We know from the division algorithm that there exist $s, t \in \Z$ such that $a = bs + t$ with $0 \leq t < b$. By substitution, we have
\begin{align*}
    2k + 1 &= (2q + 1)s + t \\
    t &= 2k + 1 - (2q + 1)s
\end{align*}

\subsection{Problem}
List the integers $100!$, $100^{100}$, $2^{100}$, and $(50!)^2$ in order of increasing size with reasoning provided.

\subsection{Solution}
In order of increasing size, we have
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $2^{100}$
    \item $(50!)^2$
    \item $100!$
    \item $100^{100}$
\end{enumerate}
To understand this, we note that each of these expressions can be written as the product of 100 terms. The first expression, $2^{100}$, is the smallest because each term is only 2. The second expression, $(50!)^2$, is the product of the numbers 1 through 50 and then 1 through 50 again. Every term is greater than those appearing in the first expression except for the two ones. The third expression, $100!$, is the product of the numbers 1 through 100. The first 50 terms are the same as those in the second expression, but after that the terms are strictly larger. The fourth expression, $100^{100}$, is the product of one hundred hundreds, so every term is greater than all but one of the terms in expression three.

\subsection{Problem}
Find the highest power of 5 that divides $1000!$.

\subsection{Solution}
Since $1000!$ is the product of an ascending sequence of numbers and every $5^\text{th}$ term is a multiple of 5, every $5^\text{th}$ term adds a power to our divisor. Similarly, every $25^\text{th}$ term is a multiple of 5 twice, so these terms add 2 to the power of our divisor. The same applies for multiples of $125$ adding 3 to the power and multiples of $625$ adding 4 to the power. Since we have $\frac{1000}{5}$ multiples of 5, $\frac{1000}{25}$ multiples of 25, $\frac{1000}{125}$ multiples of 125, and $\floor{\frac{1000}{625}}$ multiples of 625, we find that our power should be $\frac{1000}{5} + \frac{1000}{25} + \frac{1000}{125} + \floor{\frac{1000}{625}} = 200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249$ and the highest power of 5 that divides $1000!$ is $\boxed{5^{249}}$.
